# Welcome!

This is fun little website, I built while studying in Vilnius Coding School bootcamp.  
Project is made width traditional web technologies.  
The website is quite heavy on css, thanks to it I've learned a lot about css, wich was my main goal.  
It's responsive, uses owl carousel, and some custom js.
